							<h2>I like to get work done properly and I will always leave a happy customer.</h2>
							<span>I am here to solve your problems and come up with a solution that will fit your needs. I think that communication is the key for a successful web project. That's why I prefer to work with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile development methodology</a>. It consists on a iterative and incremental build approach that will allow your project to be flexible, quickly deployed and at the most effective cost (<a href="http://www.allaboutagile.com/10-good-reasons-to-do-agile-development/">read all the advantages</a>).</span>

							<h3>Requirement Analysis</h3>
							<p>This is the most important part for both of us. I will here discover and understand your needs and what you want to achieve.  The more I know about what you need to accomplish, the better my chances are of creating the website you want. We will discuss here about your goals, target users, budget and deadline.</p>
