<p>Alerti est une solution de veille et d'analyse des m√©dias sociaux that want to control what is said about them online.</p>
<p>A big part of the Ruby on Rails application is a crawling system that gathers all information needed for the users. With a constant growth, this system started to work slowly with some database tables of several hundred million rows.</p>
<p>My mission was to make this app scale to handle more and more users. I started doing some research on different technologies, benchmarking for different databases and optimizing db indexing and db structure.</p>
<p>The second part was building the new architecture for the crawler that could scale whatever the charge. We used for that the following technologies: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.tokutek.com/">TokuDB</a> as a sql engine
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> for background parallel job processing
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">rabbitMQ</a> for messaging service between apps
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> for caching data
